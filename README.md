**[AI6121] Computer Vision** is an elective course within the Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence Graduate Programme **(MSAI)**, offered by the School of Computer Science and Engineering **(SCSE)** at Nanyang Technological University **(NTU)** in Singapore. This repository pertains to the AI6121 course of **Semester 1, AY2023-2024**, commencing in August 2023. The esteemed instructor guiding this course is Prof. Lu Shijian.

**Computer vision** has garnered escalating interest, propelled by recent advancements in deep learning, particularly in convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and more. Leading global IT giants such as Google, Apple, Alibaba, Amazon, Tencent, and Baidu have made substantial investments and will continue to do so in diverse computer vision technologies. These technologies are in high demand across a wide spectrum of applications and domains, including robotics, autonomous driving, surveillance and security, computer-aided medical diagnosis, and beyond.

The primary objective of this course is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the foundational mathematics underpinning **computer vision and machine learning**, the fundamentals of image analysis, and machine learning techniques specific to computer vision. It will also cover computer vision technologies related to **detection**, **recognition**, and **classification tasks**. Throughout the course, a series of real-world problems and challenges will be presented through case studies and projects. By the course's conclusion, students will have a solid grasp of various machine learning and computer vision technologies and will be well-equipped to design their own systems for real-world problem-solving.
